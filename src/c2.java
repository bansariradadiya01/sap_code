//2) The class Movie is started below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class
//has the following three class variables:
//● title, which is a Stringrepresenting the title of the movie
//● studio, which is a Stringrepresenting the studio that made the movie
//● rating, which is a Stringrepresenting the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
//public class Movie {
//private String title;
//private String studio;
//private String rating;
//// your code goes here
//}
//a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title of the
//movie, a Stringrepresenting the studio, and a Stringrepresenting the rating as its
//arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values.
//b) Write a second constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title
//of the movie and a Stringrepresenting the studio as its arguments, and sets the respective
//class variables to these values, while the class variable ratingis set to "PG".
//c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movieas its argument, and
//returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may
//assume the input array is full of Movieinstances. The returned array need not be full.
//d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Moviewith the title “Casino
//Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
