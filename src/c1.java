//1) the java class called holidayis started below. an object of class holidayrepresents a holiday during the year.
// this class has three instance variables:
// ● name, which is a stringrepresenting the name of the holiday
// ● day, which is an intrepresenting the day of the month of the holiday
// ● month, which is a stringrepresenting the month the holiday is in
// public class holiday {
// private string name;
// private int day;
// private string month;
// your code goes here }
// a) write a constructor for the class holiday, which takes a stringrepresenting the name,
// an intrepresenting the day,
// and a stringrepresenting the month as its arguments,
// and sets the class variables to these values.
// b) write a method insamemonth, which compares two instances of the class holiday,and returns the boolean value trueif they have the same month, and falseif they do not.
// c) write a method avgdatewhich takes an array of base type holidayas its argument, and returns a doublethat is the average of the dayvariables in the holidayinstances in the array.
// you may assume that the array is full (i.e. does not have any null entries).
// d) write a piece of code that creates a holidayinstance with the name “independence day”, with the day “4”, and with the month “july”.
